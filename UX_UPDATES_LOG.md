# ✅ UX & Contact Info Updates Completed

## 1. 🚀 Enhanced User Experience
- **Smart Auto-Scroll:** The "Scroll to Top" behavior now ONLY activates on the dedicated `/order` page. It is disabled on the homepage (`/#order`) to prevent disrupting the user's browsing flow.
- **Faster Order Execution:** The "Confirm Order" process is now significantly faster. Email notifications are sent in the background, so the user sees the success screen immediately without waiting for emails to send.
- **Auto-Copy & Redirect:** Upon successful order submission:
  - The Order ID is **automatically copied** to the clipboard.
  - The user is **automatically redirected** to the tracking page after 1 second.
- **No Copy Alert:** Removed the annoying alert popup when copying the Order ID. It now copies silently to the clipboard.
